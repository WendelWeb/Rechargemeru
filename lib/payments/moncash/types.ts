/**
 * lib/payments/moncash/types.ts — the contract every MonCash provider honours.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS MORE THAN ONE PROVIDER: MonCash can be reached two ways, and
 * which one is available depends on paperwork, not on code.
 *
 *   - `direct`  — Digicel's own REST API. No middleman and no extra fee, but
 *                 it needs a Digicel merchant contract, which takes weeks.
 *   - `bazik`   — Bazik (api.bazik.io), a Haitian aggregator that fronts
 *                 MonCash. Self-serve credentials, so it can be live today.
 *
 * They are deliberately behind ONE interface so the rest of the app — order
 * creation, the callbacks, settlement, the admin probe — never learns which
 * one is in use. Switching is an env var, not a refactor.
 *
 * THE SHAPE ITSELF IS NOT MONCASH-SPECIFIC. NatCash works the same way, so the
 * order/payment/failure shapes live in lib/payments/gateway.ts and are
 * re-exported here under their MonCash names.
